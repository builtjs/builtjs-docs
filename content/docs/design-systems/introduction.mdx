# Design systems overview

A design system is a comprehensive framework that provides a set of reusable components, guidelines, and standards to ensure consistency in design and development. It includes visual elements like typography, color schemes, and icons, as well as UI components. 

You can easily apply a design system to your theme by copying three files from the [Built.js Design Systems Github repository](https://github.com/builtjs/builtjs-design-systems/tree/main).

Currently there are two Built.js design systems:

- [Basic](https://github.com/builtjs/builtjs-design-systems/tree/main/design-systems/basic)
- [ShadCN](https://github.com/builtjs/builtjs-design-systems/tree/main/design-systems/shadcn)

# Creating community themes and plugins
If you're interested in designing Built.js themes or plugins to be used by the community, following the guidelines of a design system will help you keep conflicts between plugins and themes to a minimum.

Community themes and plugins should adhere to a design system defined in the [Built.js Design Systems Github repository](https://github.com/builtjs/builtjs-design-systems/tree/main).
