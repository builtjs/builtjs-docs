A Module represents all the features and functionality to fulfill a particular use case. It is a top-level architectural component for a site, containing all the pages and sections necessary to fulfil a requirement.

It represents a business use case, like "Make Contact" or "View Features" but is usually named simply with one word (like "Contact" or "Features").

For example, if you have a client who wants a their audience to learn about their business in their website, the use case might look like this:

> Learn about organization

From an information architecture point of view, this might result in these pages and sections:
- About page with one section called "About Landing"
- About Teaser section (on Home page) called "About Teaser"

In a Built.js Theme, all of this would be encapsulated in what we call a "Module" (in this case called "About").

The code to create this module in your Built.js Theme would look like this:
```json title="public/data/modules.json" copy
{
  "modules": [
        {
      "title": "Contact",
      "description": "Encourages and facilitates making contact",
      "name": "contact",
      "modulePages": [
        { "name": "contactBase" },
        { "name": "servicesContactTeaser" }
      ],
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```
As you can see, a module has Module Pages, which help you to configure which sections go on which pages for the module.

You can also include another module as a submodule, like this:

```json title="public/data/modules.json" copy
{
  "modules": [
    {
      ...
      "modules": [
        {
          "name": "team"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "team",
      ...
      "parent": {
        "name": "about"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
