import { File, Folder, Files } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";

In a Built.js theme or plugin, a schema defines the fields used in:

- [Content Types](/docs/concepts/content-type)
- [Elements](/docs/concepts/element)
- [Global](/docs/concepts/global)
- [Sections](/docs/concepts/section)

This means that you can select the fields you want for any of these and when the site is built, it will come with a Sanity CMS which includes the fields you defined.
The easiest way to configure schemas is through the Theme/Plugin Design in the [Built Studio](/built-studio).
A content type can have the following data types:

- `biginteger`
- `boolean`
- `date`
- `decimal`
- `email`
- `enumeration`
- `float`
- `image`
- `integer`
- `json`
- `password`
- `relation`
- `portabletext`
- `string`
- `text`
- `time`

Element, global, and section content types can also have the above-mentioned fields, except:

- `relation`, because a relation field defines the relationship (e.g. "one to many") between content types only.
- `uid`, because this is used for slugs of content types only.

Find out more about [data types](/docs/concepts/data-types-common).

When you export your theme or plugin from the studio, a `schemas` directory will be created in the `public/data` directory with the following JSON files:

<Files>
  <Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="data" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="schemas" defaultOpen>
        <File name="content-types.json" />
        <File name="elements.json" />
        <File name="global.json" />
        <File name="sections.json" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Each of these JSON files will have a `fields` object which will contain the definitions, like this:

```json copy
...
"fields": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string",
      "required": true
    },
    "slug": {
      "type": "uid",
      "targetField": "title",
      "required": true
    },
    "body": {
      "type": "portabletext"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "text"
    },
    "featuredImage": {
      "type": "image"
    },
    "date": {
      "type": "date",
      "required": true
    }
},
...
```
