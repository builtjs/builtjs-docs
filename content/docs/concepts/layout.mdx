# Layout

When you export a Theme or Plugin, by default, the layout will be a simple header and footer with the main content between. You can see this in the exported theme/plugin's ```public/data/layout.json```:
```json title="public/data/layout.json" copy
{
  "layout": {
    "contentIndex": 1,
    "sections": [
      {
        "name": "header"
      },
      {
        "name": "footer"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The "contentIndex" with value of 1 means that the main content (all the module's sections) should be inserted at an index of 1. In the sections array above, inserting at index of 1 would put the main content between the header and the footer.
When the site is built from the theme, the ```components/layout/layout.js``` file would look like this: 

```tsx title="components/layout/layout.js" copy
import Header1 from "@/components/templates/headers/header1/header1";
import Footer1 from "@/components/templates/footers/footer1/footer1";
const Layout = (props) => {
  const { children, headerContent, footerContent } = props;
  return (
    <>
      <Header1 content={headerContent} />
        <main>{children}</main>
      <Footer1 content={footerContent} />
    </>
  );
};

export default Layout;
```

  Please note that Built.js themes and sites use one common layout for all pages.
