# Theme

A Built.js theme is a configurable template site that allows you to create a customized website with accompanying content management system. Sites are created from a theme in [Built Studio](https://studio.builtjs.com). Themes include settings which makes it possible for users to design their site by business use case.

A Theme is simply a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project. Here is an example:

Code: [https://github.com/richjava/corporate-basic](https://github.com/richjava/corporate-basic)<br/>
Demo: [https://builtjs-theme-corporate.vercel.app](https://builtjs-theme-corporate.vercel.app)

Along with regular Next.JS pages and React components, a theme or plugin project contains a set of ```data``` files in the ```public``` directory.

The data model is outlined in [How Built.js works](/docs/concepts/concepts-overview). More information about this can be found in the [Data Model Reference](/docs/data-model-reference).
