# App

Every theme and plugin needs metadata, such as its name, and you can set this on the App page of the Theme or Plugin Designer in [Built Studio](/built-studio).
Once you have exported the theme or plugin, you will see these values in the project's `theme.json` or `plugin.json` file.

<Files>
  <Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
      <File name="..." />
      <File name="theme.json or plugin.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>
