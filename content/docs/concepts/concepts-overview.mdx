# How Built.js works

## What is a theme?

A [theme](/docs/concepts/theme) is a Next.js app which has [data files](/docs/data-model-reference). It is used for creating Next.js websites that have a Sanity content management system. 

A theme can have any number of [modules](/docs/concepts/module). A module represents a business use case, and contains all the pages and sections to fulfill the use case. It has [module pages](/docs/concepts/module-page), each of which assigns sections to a page. Consequently, a [page](/concepts/page) is "dumb", not directly determining its sections.

A [section](/docs/concepts/section) determines the content. It can have one or more [templates](/docs/concepts/template) which display the content differently, giving the end user of the theme a number of options for the section's user interface. A section can have a number of [collections](/docs/concepts/collections). A collection is a group of items, or entries, of a certain [content type](/docs/concepts/content-type). Collections may or may not have an associated [article] page(/docs/concepts/article).

You may wish to have small reusable content types that can be used for UI components. You could use simple object or alternatively, you could use [elements](/docs/concepts/elements).


A theme can also have any number of [plugins](/docs/concepts/plugin). A plugin is a single module which is external to the theme. You may also need to store global data for your theme. The [global](/concepts/global) content type can used for this purpose. Currently, Built.js themes and sites are limited to one common [layout](/concpets/layout) for all pages.

## How are themes created?
If you know how to create React components, you can easily create your own theme. You can:
1. Create a theme through the Built.js CLI: ```npx create-built-app new theme```
2. Create a theme manually through Built Studio.

To create a theme maually through Built Studio, follow the following steps:
 
<Steps>
<Step>
### Create the theme's definitions in Built Studio
 
To create a theme, you can use the [Built Studio](https://www.builtjs.com) Designer to define the modules, pages, sections and other items.
</Step>
<Step>
### Export the theme, set up the Next.js theme project, and create components
 
When you export (download) your theme from Built Studio, it contains the definitions but no code for the sections yet. The setup process outlined in the README will help you create the Next.js project with the theme configuration. Then, you design the React components for each section. 
</Step>
<Step>
### Publish theme to your Built Studio workspace

When you're ready to use your theme to create sites with, publish it to Built Studio using `npx create-built-app publish`. 
</Step>
</Steps>

## How are plugins created?
A plugin is very similar to a theme, except it only has one [module](/docs/concepts/module), so the process is essentially the same.
