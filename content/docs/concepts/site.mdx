You can create a site from a theme in the [Built Studio](/built-studio). When you export the site from the studio, a zip file is downloaded which contains a `config` directory and a `README.md` file.
The README file contains all the directions to setup and run the project - a Next.js frontend with a Sanity CMS. Data will be stored and managed by Sanity in the cloud.

## Accessing the Sanity Studio

After running the site, you can access the project's Sanity Studio at `/admin`. It will include content for all section, entries, and global data in the site. Sanity schemas are defined in the project's `sanity/schemas` directory.

## Next.js pages and components

Components from the theme (and any plugins that the theme uses) are carried through into the site. This is an example of a page in a Built site:

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx" copy
import React from "react";
import { getProps } from "@/lib/api";import { GetStaticProps } from "next";
import Error from "next/error";
import { withRouter } from "next/router";
import Seo from "@/components/templates/head/seo";
import GhRichjavaBuiltjsPluginBlogList2 from "@/components/plugins/gh_richjava_builtjs-plugin-blog/templates/lists/list2";
import Cover1 from "@/components/templates/covers/cover1";
import Layout from "@/components/layout";

const Page = (props:any) => {
  if (props.error) {
    return <Error statusCode={props.error.code} />
  }
  return (
     <>
	<Seo content={props.homeSeoContent} />
		<Layout headerContent={props.headerContent}  footerContent={props.footerContent} >
			 <Cover1  content={props.mainLandingContent} />
			 <GhRichjavaBuiltjsPluginBlogList2  content={props.blogTeaserContent} />
			</Layout>
		</>
  );
};

export default withRouter(Page);

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  let props = await getProps({pageName: 'home'});
  return {
    props: props,
    revalidate: 10
  };
}
```
