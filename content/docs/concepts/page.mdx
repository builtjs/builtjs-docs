A Page represents a web page. You may expect a Page to have sections, but Built themes and plugin pages do not. Instead, it's a ModulePage which specifies which sections belong to a page. This way, pages and sections can be wrapped up in a module so the end user of the theme can choose to include the pages and sections by simply adding a module.

After you've exported the theme/plugin from [Built Studio](/built-studio), you can find the page configuration in ```public/data/pages.json```. This is an example of a page:

```json title="public/data/pages.json" copy
{
  "pages": [
    {
      "name": "home",
      "title": "Home"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

In order to specify which sections belong on a page, you need to create a [module page](/docs/concepts/module-page).
