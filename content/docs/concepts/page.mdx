A Page represents a web page. You may expect a Page to have sections, but Built themes and plugin pages do not. Instead, it's a ModulePage which specifies which sections belong to a page. This way, pages and sections can be wrapped up in a module so the end user of the theme can choose to include the pages and sections by simply adding a module.

After you've exported the theme/plugin from [Built Studio](/built-studio), you can find the page configuration in ```public/data/pages.json```. This is an example of a page:

  ```json title="public/data/pages.json" copy
  {
    "pages": [
      {
        "name": "home",
        "title": "Home"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```

In order to specify which sections belong on a page, you need to create a [module page](/docs/concepts/module-page). 

If a page is for an article page (i.e. a page which has a route like `pages/post/[slug].js`), the page object is required to have a contentType property, for example:
```json title="public/data/pages.json" copy
  {
    "pages": [
      {
        "name": "blogArticle",
        "contentType": {
          "name": "post",
          "config": {
            "populate": [
              {
                "name": "author",
                "type": "author",
                "populate": [
                  {
                    "name": "profile",
                    "type": "profile"
                  }
                ]
              },
              {
                "name": "tags",
                "type": "tag"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```
