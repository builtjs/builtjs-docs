# How to create a theme

It's easy to create a reusable theme using [Built Studio](/built-studio) and your custom designed React components.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create and configure a theme in Built Studio 
 
In the themes workspace of Built Studio, click the "Create Theme" button. Use the Theme Designer to define all the pages, sections, collections and other items for your theme.
 </Step>
 <Step>
### Export the and set up the theme
 
Download and extract the theme zip file and follow the instructions in the `README` to create a Next.js project and set the configurations. This includes running `npx create-built-app update` to update the theme with the plugins specified in the `theme.json` file.
</Step>
<Step>
### Update the theme's plugins
Run:
```bash copy
npx create-built-app update
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Create your theme's templates (React components)

Go to the project's `components/templates` directory and design each template. The section data you defined (when creating the theme in Built Studio) will be available to use in the template.

</Step>
<Step>
### Publish the theme

Publish your theme to your Built Studio workspace by running: 

```bash copy
npx create-built-app publish
```

The studio will first validate the theme to make sure it meets the basic requirements.
