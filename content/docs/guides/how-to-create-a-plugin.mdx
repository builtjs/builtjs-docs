Creating a plugin is almost identical to [creating a theme](/guides/how-to-create-a-theme). It's easy to create a reusable plugin using [Built Studio](/built-studio) and your custom designed React components.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create and configure a plugin in Built Studio 
 
In the plugins workspace of Built Studio, click the "Create Plugin" button. Use the Plugin Designer to define all the pages, sections, collections and other items for your plugin.
 </Step>
 <Step>
### Export the and set up the plugin
 
Download and extract the theme zip file and follow the instructions in the `README` to create a Next.js project and set the configurations.
</Step>
<Step>
### Create your plugin's templates (React components)

Go to the project's ```components/templates``` directory and design each template. The section data you defined (when creating the plugin in Built Studio) will be available to use in the template.
</Step>
<Step>
### Publish the plugin

Publish your plugin to your Built Studio workspace by running:
```bash copy
npx create-built-app publish
```
 The studio will first validate the plugin to make sure it meets the basic requirements.
</Step>
</Steps>
