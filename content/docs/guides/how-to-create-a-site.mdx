You can create a site an with a community theme at any time, and once you have your own themes in the studio, you can create sites with them too. The basic process for this is:

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(57.36842105263158% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/YEqv9M4DBSHDye5GZqHi?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true"
    title="Creating a site | Built.js"
    frameBorder="0"
    loading="lazy"
    webkitAllowFullScreen
    mozAllowFullScreen
    allowFullScreen
    allow="clipboard-write"
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light",
    }}
  />
</div>
