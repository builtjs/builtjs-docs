# How to create a site

You can create a site an with a community theme at any time, and once you have your own themes in the studio, you can create sites with them too. The basic process for this is:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select a theme
 
In [Built Studio](https://builtjs.com), select a [community theme](http://builtjs.com/community) or [one of your own](http://builtjs.com).
 </Step>
 <Step>
### Select modules you need for your site
 
These modules will determine the features of your site.
</Step>
<Step>
### Configure your site pages

Choose the section templates you want, delete any pages and sections you don't want.
</Step>
<Step>
### Export the site

This will download a zip file to your device. You can then go through the steps in the README to setup and run the site

</Steps>


You are then ready to make any changes you want or directly deploy the site on a host of your choosing.
